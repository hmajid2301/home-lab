# ğŸ‘‹ Hello

Hey there! ğŸ‘‹

This website serves as documentation for my home lab.
Including how it is set up, what devices are part of it and various other tooling.

> Note this site is a WIP, I have just created a general structure of things I want to write about. Hence many pages may be blank.
